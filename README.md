# EmployeeDir

## User Story

- As a user, I want to be able to view my entire employee directory at once so that I have quick access to their information. I also want to quickly search for employees by their name and sort by name, number, email, date of birth and gender. By doing so, this helps me to keep track of employee records with ease and efficiency. 

The user should be able to:

- Sort the table by at least one category

- Filter the users by at least one property.

# Instructions:

To run the app, a user will click on the deployed link below and the list of 100 randomly generated employee records will download. Next, a user can search, filter and sort the employee records as needed.
